Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using Python and Tkinter on Raspberry Pi

This step is to connect everything and set up the operating system now that the microSD
card and other components are ready. First, let’s connect each and every peripheral:
1. Place the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi’s bottom card slot.
2. Use any one of the four USB ports to connect the mouse and keyboard.
3. Using an HDMI cable designed specifically for your Raspberry Pi model. Connect a
monitor to one of the HDMI ports.
4. Link a power source to the USB power outlet.
After connecting the peripherals, turn on your Raspberry Pi to set up the operating
system

Setup Wizard
Upon initial boot, Raspbian offers an installation process that assists with setting up your
Wi-Fi network, password, locale, and operating system update. Proceed and carry out these
actions as directed.
We may start learning Python on the Raspberry Pi by restarting the operating system
when we have finished the instructions!

Python was chosen as the primary language by the Raspberry Pi
Foundation due to its strength, adaptability, and user-friendliness. Raspbian ships with
Python preloaded, so we’ll be good to go right away.
When it comes to programming Python on the Raspberry Pi, we have a wide range of
choices. Throughout the project, we will utilize the widely-liked option is the Mu editor.
